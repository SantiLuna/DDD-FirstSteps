# DDD-FirstSteps

This repository is a template in WIP. The idea is to help people to take their first steps in the domain-oriented application world.

It is a work in progress, so it implies that there may be issues that are not correctly resolved.

I hope to improve as I grow in knowledge.

All kinds of suggestions are accepted and I would be grateful to receive knowledge from people with more experience in clean architectures.
